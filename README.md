# Renewable Energy Forecast project

## Overview
The "Renewable Energy Forecast" project is a data science initiative aimed at predicting renewable energy generation. This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to forecast the energy production from renewable sources, mostly wind, in order to assist energy providers and grid operators, in making informed decisions.
The use case of the project is based on the wind energy generation in France.
